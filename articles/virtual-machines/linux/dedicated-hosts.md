## Next steps

- You can deploy a dedicated host using the [Azure CLI](dedicated-hosts-cli.md), [portal](dedicated-hosts-portal.md), and [PowerShell](../windows/dedicated-hosts-powershell.md).

- For more information, see the [Dedicated hosts](dedicated-hosts.md) overview.

- There is sample template, found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/201-vm-dedicated-hosts/README.md), that uses both zones and fault domains for maximum resiliency in a region.
